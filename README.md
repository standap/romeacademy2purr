# romeacademy2purr
this repository contains code and files for transforming the artl@s Rome academy data as stored in Omeka to archiveable data in PURR. 


These are the step needed that need to be taken before the dataset can
be archived: 
0. locate q-identifiers in wiki data for all persons, if they are not available, create wikidata records 
1. prepare files for wiki data
2. identify GIS information for places which do not have it yet
3. remove HTML tags from the table
4. normalise the content in the table wherever possible 
5. data dictionary (that I unfortunately cannot produce on my own and
will need some help from you)
