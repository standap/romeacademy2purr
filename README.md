# romeacademy2purr
this repository contains code and files for transforming the artl@s Rome academy data as stored in Omeka to archiveable data in PURR. 


These are the step needed that need to be taken before the dataset can
be archived: 

- [x] locate q-identifiers in wiki data for all persons.  
- [x] if they are not available, create wikidata records  
- [x] prepare files for wiki data  
- [x] identify GIS information for places which do not have it yet  
- [x] remove HTML tags from the table  
- [x] normalise the content in the table wherever possible  
- [x] data dictionary
